%\chapter*{Abstract}

%This report demonstrates a simple mechanism protocol, proposed by Mr. PUZIO Pasquale, for deduplicating data of cloud storage in client side which reduces the risk of data leakage from \acrfull{csp}. The mechanism bases on differences between the popular data which have a low sercurity level and un-popular which have schematically security. Besides, the mechanism also has some advantages in efficiency and security level when comparing with other mechanisms.

		\subsection{Requirement}
		Currently, TTool has a function to find components inside the opened model according to a string which is provided by user. The main purpose is supporting for locating components by a string in case the working on large graph. There is a concern that the user would like to inquire more information about the graph, which may be the techical detail of component, the other relationship between components,the variant of the component, usage of component in another purpose,  etc. These material could not be embeded in graph's components. \par
		The approach in this part of the project is extracting the data from outside TTool, specially, by internet and a vulnerabiliy database.In internet approach,  thank to search engine such as Google and Google Scholar, finding the related information of a string can be perform by an URL to these services. Another way to get infomation is through a vulnerability database, which is an other part of this project.Threrefore the main requirement in this part is:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item  Implementing a GUI, allowing the user can perform extended searching to outside resource by string and following options.
			\item  Retrieving the result from the internet, namely Google and Google Scholar.
			\item Design and implementing a protocol to communicate to the database in order to get the information and display to user.
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Environment}
		As an extention for Ttool's User Interface, this part of project involes directy to source code of TTool, which is competable with Java 7. \par
		There is an external library, named JSoup, is taken avantage in order to manipulate the request and response to Search Engine, and parse the HTML-format response. Jsoup is an open source project distributed under the liberal MIT license. It can be found at http://jsoup.org/. Jsoup jar jsoup-1.8.1.jar is put in ./bin directory and Makefile is modified to make sure the library is loaded when compliling TTool.
		\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	basic:
	$(JAVAC) $(SOURCEPATH) $(TTOOL_SRC) $(CLASSPATH) $(TTOOL_BIN)/jsoup-1.8.1.jar $(TTOOL_SRC)/*.java	
		\end{lstlisting}
		\subsection {Graphic interface}
		As the requirement, the user desires to view the more information which either directly or indirectly relevant  to the elements in the working model. The task on graphic interface are creating a method to create the keyword and build a form in order to display the request, as well as the result of searching for user.\par
		 A prerequisite of retreving the information is composing a keyword which will be  provided to the searching function. The main source to make up the keyword is selecting from the components in the model. Besides, user also can input and manipulate the keyword before searching.\par
		For the convinient, there are four options for user can compose desired keyword:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Type the keyword into the search field on the menu bar of TTool.
			\item Hold Ctrl and left click on the component to get the name of component as keyword.
			\item Hold Ctrl and left click on conponents consequently, then right click on the model and select option "External Search". The list of name of selected components will be used as the keyword.
			\item Hold Alt and left click on a component. The form will be displayed with the name of seleted component.
			\item When the form is showing. the user can add to the list keywords a name of another component on graph by holding Ctrl and left click on that component. 
			\item In addition, user can also give the input in the search form.
		\end{itemize}
		Then, the selected keywords will be sent to the form, named External Search , which allow user to change the content of query,  select the source to send query, the options of request.
		To open the form, there are 4 options:
		\begin {itemize}
		\item From the main menu Tool $\rightarrow$ External Search\par
		\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{mainmenu_crop.png}
		\item From  working graph, through the context menu ( Right click  $\rightarrow$ External Search ) \par
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{contextmenu_crop.png}
		\item From the menu bar, through the icon External Search.\par
		\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{menubar.png}
		\item  Hold Alt and left click on a component. The form will be displayed with the name of seleted component.
		
		\end{itemize}
		
		The form is place where the query will is contructed by collecting keywords, options, target data sources. As well as, there are tables and text field to represent the searching response. \par
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{ExternalSearch.png}\par
		The final keyword will be formed by the list components' names which are concatenated to each other. In addition, each name will be splitted by the uper characters. The reason for splitting is making the keyword more searchable by search engines.\par
		For each target data source ( Google, Google Scholar and Database), there are the reseved options and tab to display the result. \par
		The related source code for the External Search :
		\begin {itemize}
			\item ./src/ui/window/JDialogSearchBox.java: This is the main implimentation of GUI for Searching Dialog. 
			\item ./src/ui/TDiagramPanel.java : Menu context is added the option for External Search.
			\item ./src/ui/TDiagramMouseManager.java : A few lines of code catches the event of mouse when click on components with special keys ( Ctrl, Alt) 
			\item ./src/ui/MainGUI.java : The instance of JDialogSearchBox belongs to MainGUI which allows the search function can be accessed by every context of TTool. 
			An added code supports to reuse the search field in menu bar for both Internal Search and External Search. It also allows to open a External Search Dialog by a button beside the search field. 
			\item ./src/ui/TGUIAction.java : register  new actions for Internal and External, included icon and description.
