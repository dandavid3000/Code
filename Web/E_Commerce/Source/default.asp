                                    page you see is called Default.asp and this is one of several default documents
                                    which will be shown if there is no explicitly specified document in URL. In order
                                    to stop showing this page you can delete, rename or replace it with your own Default.asp
                                    file. Here is the list of other default documents:
                                    <br>
                                    &nbsp; Default.aspx, Default.htm, Default.asp, Index.asp, Index.html, Index.htm,
                                    Index.php.
                                    <br>
                                    &nbsp; The order of default documents is important. If you have 2 or more default
                                    documents our server will show one which goes earlier in the list.
                                    <br>
                                    &nbsp; You also can change the list of default documents in our control panel.&nbsp;

                                    you don’t have a web site yet you need a tool that is more convenient for you to
                                    build it. We have a simple web site editor, but it is a fact that most online web
                                    site&nbsp; builders are less sophisticated and less convenient that tools installable
                                    on your computer. Many of modern applications have build in ability of making HTML
                                    files – web files. All of MS Office applications have this ability.</span></li>
                                <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">&nbsp; Please,
                                    upload your web content to the same folder where this default document is located.
                                    This is especially important if you run dynamic applications. This default folder
                                    of your website is configured as an application and web server will be looking for
                                    configuration files in this folder. You have 2 ways of uploading.
                                    <br>
                                    &nbsp; 1) Use FTP. Make sure that your FTP is turned into passive mode (Most likely).<br>
                                    &nbsp; You will find the FTP information in Web site&#39;s properties page in our
                                    control panel.
                                    <br>
                                    &nbsp; 2) We also have web based file manager in the control panel. You can speed
                                    up the upload with automatic unzip capability. </span></li>

                                    this time our web servers support Plain HTML files (extention *.htm, *.html), Active
                                    Server Pages (extention &nbsp;*.asp), ASP.NET 1.1 - 4.0, PHP (Windows 2008 only).
                                    You can also store any other types of files.

                                    &nbsp; In order to execute your page after uploading you need to specify name of
                                    the page after your site name (Ex. Your site name is “MySite.com”, the page name
                                    is “MyFirstPage.html”. In order to execute this page you need to type following
                                    in your browser: “MySite.com/MyFirstPage.html”). If you have any of default documents
                                    it’s not necessary to add it after the site name. </span></li>
