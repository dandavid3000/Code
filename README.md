>For those who may concern about my work I have been doing during my study. This folder contains many different subfolders storing various projects. There are my 6-month internship at SAP Labs France, Eurecom semester project, exercises as well as projects relating to software development in different programming languages.

#Introduction
Most of the projects I mainly finished in C/C++ or in Java. Python is a new language that I've had a chance to access recently since my Master's program at Eurecom under courses such as 'Secure System', 'SoftDev', and 'Forensics'. I'm really interested in this language, still studying it, and catching up. Some projects you'll find strange because they're not in English because I am still working on them.

## Secure integration of Internet of Things
## Attack Crawler for Modern Networked Systems
Because we have a large scale attacks on networked systems have been conducted in recent year. Unfortunately, to study and analyse those attacks is quite complex, and requires gathering information from very diverse sourses.
The objective of this project is to evaluate which relevant information can be exracted from the internet and provided to users.
In particular, we developed a security feature for [TTool](http://ttool.telecom-paristech.fr/) which is an open-source software, and it's develop by my professor [Ludovic Apvrille](http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~apvrille/) at Telecom ParisTech.

The project was divided into two main parts. Web crawler, and The assistant; a friendly interface which allows users to retrieve relevant information from the Datebase (Web crawler).

Regarding to our work in this projects:
> Studied, analysed, and illustrated a well-known attack [Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) as a SysML-Sec attack model.
> Implemented a friendly user interface for users to retrieve information, perform the search
> Designed, and implemented a secure protocol as a bridge to let TTool, and The Crawler interact together.

The final report for this work is available [here](Java/Eurecom/SemesterFinalResult/FullSubmitted_Source/SemesterProjectReport_VO.pdf) along with the [source code](Java/Eurecom/SemesterFinalResult/FullSubmitted_Source/TTool.zip). The protocol is developed step by step being stored [here](Java/Eurecom/SmallClient_Server/). From the simple one to multithreaded, and SSL socket usage.

I hope you will see more interesting project I will participate in. Currently I am looking for a position to start my career. I'm passionate about Software development, Internet of Things, and Security.
